# Space Jumper

A small logical game about finding the right way ðŸŽ® Developed in Unity.

[Play it on itch.io](https://peterfication.itch.io/space-jumper) or [download a release (uncertified)](https://github.com/peterfication/space-jumper-unity/releases).

## DISCLAIMER

```
The idea for SpaceJumper is originally from an old DOS game. I can't find it anywhere online
because I forgot the name. So if somebody knows the name or even has a copy of it I would be
very happy to hear about it! :)
